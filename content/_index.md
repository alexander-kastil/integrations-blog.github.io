# Welcome to my blog

I am a Software Engineer with a passion for Microsoft technologies. I have experience in various domains including web development, cloud computing, and artificial. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experiences through writing and teaching.

The site contains articles, tutorials, and resources related to Microsoft technologies, cloud computing, and software development. Throughout my career, I have written numerous classes about Microsoft technologies - for simplicity I have included those that I am still teaching.

My first Microsoft Certification goes back to 1997 when I passed the Microsoft Certified Professional exam for Windows 96. Since then I have been working with Microsoft technologies and have obtained several certifications including:

- Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT) since 2000
- Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) on Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, and Windows 2003
- Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator: Messaging on Windows 2000 and Windows 2003
- Microsoft Certified Database Administrator (MCDBA) on SQL Server 2000 and 2005
- Microsoft Certified Database Developer (MCDBD) on SQL Server 2005
- Microsoft® Certified Technology Specialist: .Net Framework 2.0, Web Applications
- Microsoft® Certified Technology Specialist: Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0, Application Development
- Microsoft® Certified Technology Specialist: Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0, Configuration
- Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer (MCSD)
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Developer Associate
- Microsoft Certified: DevOps Engineer Expert
- Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Engineer Associate

My full Microsoft Certification history can be found on my [MCT Transcript](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/alexander-kastil/transcript/dloowug2y85m9lm).

After bringing my cloud skills to expert level I started to delve deeper into the world of Cloud Native Apps and gained in-depth experience with microservices architecture, especially using Dapr, .NET Aspire and Azure Container Apps.

Being a passionate web developer I started using Angular JS and updated my skills to Angular 2+ and as a SharePoint developer I started using React JS in SharePoint Framework (SPFx) and Microsoft Teams.

In 2024 I started focusing on Microsoft Semantic Kernel, Microsoft Copilot and Agentic AI.

Besides my deep interest in always learning new technologies I am a passionate dog dad for my Sighthounds and working out in the gym since I was 14 years old. Last but not least consider myself to be a master chef in the kitchen and I love to cook for my family and friends, with heavy influence from Thai and Indian cuisine.
