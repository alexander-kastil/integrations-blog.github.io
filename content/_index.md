# Hello and welcome to my blog!

I'm a Software Engineer with a deep passion for Microsoft technologies. Over the years, I've gained experience in various domains including networking & operating system, databases, web development, content management systems & collaboration, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. I love sharing my knowledge and experiences through writing and teaching.

## What You'll Find Here

This site is packed with articles, tutorials, and resources related to Microsoft technologies, cloud computing, and software development. Throughout my career, I've written numerous classes about Microsoft technologies, and for simplicity, I've included those that I am still teaching.

## My technical Journey through several Microsoft technologies

My journey with Microsoft certifications began in 1997 when I passed the Microsoft Certified Professional exam for Windows 96. Since then, I've been working with Microsoft technologies and have obtained several certifications, including:

- Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT) since 2000
- Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) on Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, and Windows 2003
- Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator: Messaging on Windows 2000 and Windows 2003
- Microsoft Certified Database Administrator (MCDBA) on SQL Server 2000 and 2005
- Microsoft Certified Database Developer (MCDBD) on SQL Server 2005
- Microsoft® Certified Technology Specialist: .Net Framework 2.0, Web Applications
- Microsoft® Certified Technology Specialist: Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0, Application Development
- Microsoft® Certified Technology Specialist: Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0, Configuration
- Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer (MCSD)

- Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Engineer Associate

You can find my full Microsoft Certification history on my [Microsoft Transcript](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/alexander-kastil/transcript/dloowug2y85m9lm).

After bringing my cloud skills to an expert level, I delved deeper into the world of Cloud Native Apps and gained in-depth experience with microservices architecture, especially using Dapr, .NET Aspire, and Azure Container Apps.

As a passionate web developer, I started using Angular JS and later updated my skills to Angular 2+. As a SharePoint developer, I began using React JS in SharePoint Framework (SPFx) and Microsoft Teams.

In 2024, I started focusing on Microsoft Semantic Kernel, Microsoft Copilot, and Agentic AI.

## My personal Interests

Beyond my professional interests, I am a dog dad to my Sighthounds and have been working out in the gym since I was 14 years old. I also consider myself a master chef in the kitchen, with a love for cooking Thai and Indian cuisine. These culinary skills were honed during my travels around Southeast Asia, mostly between the ages of 27 and 35, where I used to escape the cold winters in Austria.
