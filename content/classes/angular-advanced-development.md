This advanced Angular workshop is designed for experienced developers aiming to master modern Angular techniques and best practices.

Covering topics from standalone components, reactive programming with RxJS and Signals, to state management with NgRx, advanced routing, and comprehensive testing strategies, the course offers a deep dive into the Angular ecosystem. Participants will also explore reusability with libraries and Nx, real-time micro-frontends, progressive web apps, and performance optimization.

Through hands-on modules, attendees will gain practical skills to architect, test, and optimize complex Angular applications.
