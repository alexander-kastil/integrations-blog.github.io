# Developing Low-Code and Pro-Code Agents and Copilots for Microsoft 365

Join our comprehensive course designed for Microsoft 365 and AI developers to master the art of developing low-code and pro-code agents and copilots for Microsoft 365. This program promises to elevate your development skills, making you proficient in the tools used to architect Copilots.

In this journey, you will first embark on an exploration of the world of Microsoft 365 and its Copilot ecosystem. You will receive an overview of the key concepts of Copilots and how to extend them in the Microsoft 365 environment.

Continuing your adventure, you will be introduced to the essence of agents, discovering the key components like knowledge and actions, and how to extend them using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). You will discern the distinctions between simple retrieval-based agents, those capable of triggering actions in existing enterprise systems, as well as autonomous or deep reasoning agents, and those orchestrated in a multi-agent environment.

Next, you will get hands-on with the practicalities of implementing low-code agents in Copilot Studio, starting with the basics. This will involve using Prompts, Topics & Variables, GenAI, Knowledge, as well as publishing your creations to different channels.

As your skills mature, you will advance to utilizing the Copilot Studio Visual Studio Code Extension, mastering automation through Agent Flows and managed Agents like the Document Processor, the integration of MCPs, Adaptive Cards, and even integrating channels like Twilio. The advanced section of Copilot Studio will conclude with the implementation of multi-agent orchestration, allowing you to create complex solutions that leverage multiple agents working together.

Your journey will then lead you to the realm of pro-code agents. Here, you will get an overview of the different implementation strategies for agents and when to use each type. You will also be introduced to the Microsoft 365 Agent Toolkit, as well as concepts of Copilot Connectors, and the new Copilot Retrieval API that allows consuming Copilot directly from your existing apps using a Microsoft Graph Endpoint.

When we get to the agents, we will start off with declarative agents, efficiently managing their capabilities like knowledge and conversation starters, API-based actions, as well as other advanced features like adaptive cards, code interpreter, and many others.

The adventure continues as you explore the creation of custom engine agents that allow you more control over aspects like choosing the right model, as well as advanced decisions such as selecting custom orchestrators like Semantic Kernel. Using the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK, you will be able to integrate Azure AI Services Agents with features like Deep Reasoning or even Multi-Agent Scenarios. You will learn to enrich these agents with custom data, leverage Azure AI Search, and employ adaptive cards. Additionally, you will implement actions based on Graph and utilize the Model Context Protocol to its fullest. We will also introduce the second flavor of custom engine agents, using the Teams AI Library V2. This will allow you to create custom engine agents that are especially suited for Teams.

Finally, you will master the critical aspects of deploying and analyzing the agents covered in this class. Ultimately, you will gain the expertise to manage agents efficiently, ensuring their seamless integration within the Microsoft 365 landscape.

At the end of this course, you will have an in-depth understanding of how to develop, deploy, and manage both low-code and pro-code agents and copilots for Microsoft 365 and always chose the right tool for the job.
