The one day "Vibe Coding with GitHub Copilot" workshop is a one-day, hands-on session designed to introduce participants to the powerful capabilities of GitHub Copilot. 

The class covers essential topics such as prompt engineering, inline code generation, and leveraging AI-powered workflows to boost productivity. Participants will explore tools for refactoring, error fixing, and automating repetitive tasks while learning to use agents, semantic search, and multi-file edits. Additional modules focus on integrating Copilot into testing workflows, creating documentation, and handling DevOps tasks like managing pull requests, resolving merge conflicts, and setting up CI/CD pipelines. 

By the end of the workshop, attendees will have practical skills to enhance their development processes and effectively integrate Copilot into various aspects of their projects.
