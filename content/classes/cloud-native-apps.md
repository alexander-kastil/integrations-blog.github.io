This comprehensive workshop guides you through the journey of designing and implementing cloud-native applications using Microsoft Azure's powerful ecosystem.

Learn how to evolve from monolithic architectures to scalable microservices, master containerization with Azure Container Apps, leverage .NET Aspire and Dapr for distributed application development, implement event-driven architectures, and optimize application performance and security.

You'll gain hands-on experience with modern cloud patterns, Azure services integration, and best practices for building resilient, scalable applications in the cloud.
